Unity Shader and Weapon Inventory System

This project showcases my learning journey in Unity shader development. As a good lerner, I created a simple weapon inventory system with custom shaders to explore the basics of real-time rendering and visual effects.

Highlights

Custom Shaders: Basic fire, water, and electric effects created using Shader Graph and HLSL.

Weapon Inventory: A simple system to switch between weapons with unique visual effects.

Learning Focus: Emphasis on understanding shaders and integrating them into gameplay.

This project is a stepping stone in my Unity shader development journey. Suggestions and feedback are welcome!
